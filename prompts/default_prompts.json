PROJECT CONTEXT: {project_context}

Translate each of the following English UI strings into {language}, providing {options_count} distinct translation alternatives that:
1. Faithfully convey the original meaning
2. Use natural, fluent phrasing that feels native to {language} speakers
3. Consider typical UI space constraints 
4. Maintain consistency of terminology
5. Preserve any variables, placeholders, or special formatting (e.g., {name}, %s, <b>bold</b>)

For each string, your {options_count} translations should offer meaningfully different phrasings or word choices, not just minor variations.

Return a properly formatted JSON object with a 'translations' array containing arrays of {options_count} translation options for each string."

PROJECT CONTEXT: {project_context}

For each UI string, evaluate the provided translation options and select the single BEST translation that:
1. Most accurately conveys the original English meaning
2. Uses natural, idiomatic {language} that a native speaker would expect
3. Maintains proper terminology consistency for the domain
4. Fits well in a user interface context
5. Follows appropriate cultural conventions

Critically evaluate each option's accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Select the translation that best balances all criteria.

PROJECT CONTEXT: {project_context}

Review and refine each translation to ensure optimal quality. For each translation:
1. Correct any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or mistranslations
2. Ensure consistent terminology across the translation set
3. Verify proper handling of UI-specific elements (buttons, menus, tooltips, etc.)
4. Adapt the language to sound natural and contextually appropriate
5. Preserve all variables/placeholders exactly as they appear in the original

Make thoughtful improvements while maintaining the core meaning. Your refinements should elevate the translation quality while preserving the original intent.

Return a properly formatted JSON object with a 'refined_translations' array containing your improved versions."

PROJECT CONTEXT: {project_context}

Evaluate each translation pair (original English and {language} translation) and rate the quality on a scale of 0-100:
- 90-100: Perfect - Flawless translation that reads like original content in the target language
- 80-89: Excellent - High-quality translation with at most minor stylistic issues
- 70-79: Good - Correct translation with some minor fluency or style issues
- 60-69: Acceptable - Adequately conveys meaning but has noticeable issues
- 40-59: Needs Improvement - Contains errors that affect comprehension
- 0-39: Poor - Serious errors, mistranslations, or unintelligible content

For each translation, consider:
1. Accuracy: Does it correctly convey the full meaning of the original?
2. Fluency: Does it read naturally in {language}?
3. Terminology: Are domain-specific terms translated consistently and correctly?
4. Cultural Appropriateness: Is it adapted properly for the target culture?
5. Formatting: Are placeholders, variables, and formatting preserved correctly?

Return a properly formatted JSON object with a 'scores' array containing numerical scores (0-100) for each translation, along with brief comments on any issues found."
